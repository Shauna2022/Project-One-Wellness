There are different sections on my website. Section one is "Pose of the day" which a random yoga pose will show up on the page for you to try as a fun challenge. If you feel as if that pose is to challenging you can click again for a new  pose.

Section two and three are differnt sets of videos that is commonly used for meditaion, studying,sleeping, and for a quick yoga routine. 

Section two is the "Meditation Music & Relaxing Sounds" part where there are 3 videos that can all be used for meditation, sleeping, studing, or just to unwine at the end of a stressful day. None of the sounds play youtube ads in the middle of the video so there is no worries about your relaxation being distrubed. 

Video one is more commonly used for meditation due to the higher noise frequency. Higher frequency sounds helps people when it comes to aligning Chakaras. It also helps with reliving stress due to the claming music playing along with the higheer frequencies.

Video 2 is commonly used as a background noise for studying. This video comes from the popular "lofi girl" (formerly known as ChilledCow) youtube channel that has 2 long running live streams that plays relaxing lofi music and uses a girl studying as their logo. in this video trhe lofi girl is also in the video.

Video 3 is commonly used as a sound to help sleep. People fall asleep easier when it comes to hearing rain. In some cases people are more sleepy on gloomy and rainy or stormy days. To immatate the sound of falling rain can have the same effect on the brain to make people feel more tired. This video does just that with the rain sounds lasting up to 10 hours so the viewers can get a full nights rest.


Section 3 is yoga and simple strech routines that varies from sitting or standing and are all under 10m mintues. 

Video 1 focous on upper back and neck streches. I added this one after a fellow classmate Kris Mally sent it in the resource channel. This is perfect for the class because we are at a computer and most of the time we are hunched over and this is perfect for making sure our posture is correct.

Video 2 focous on standing up and moving your whole body and making sure that your getting blood flow though your body. I added this one because its a good flow to do after sitting in a chair for hours.

Video 3 I added becasue this is a routine you can do in a chair. its something thats quick for our 10 mintue breaks to make sure your body is still mobil even though your still sitting.


I faced hardships when it came to my API becasue my original one had to use node which we are not woking on yet so 2 days before the due date I had to find a new API with the help of my team lead Adibur Dipta and implement the new code from scratch. I had help from classmates Charles Barlett to help me figure out why my data wasnt showing up. Classmates Iyana Marquez and David Aydin helped me understand why my data wasnt showing on the webpage after following the markdown for the lesson and also pointed me int he direction on how to make my API show random information on MDN. I also followed the lesson led by Ayla Ex with the Dummy API and that also set up the randomized data from the API and helped with the set up for the ajax call.


   In the future I want to add more activites to do to unwind and help with mental health. Such as resources for therapy, workouts that best help with mental health, and a network of people who use the website to talk to each other. I also want my page to be better aligned and have closer look to my wireframe.

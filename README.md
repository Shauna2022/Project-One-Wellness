# Wellness and Mental Health

This is a wellness resource to make sure that we are taking care of our mental health while we are taking this intense course. 
To make this website I used: 
*HTML
*CSS
*JavaScript 
*jQuery
*Lighting Yoga Api

# Getting Started

Here is my [Website Link](https://gastumentalhealth.netlify.app/)

# Future additions

In the future I want to add more activites to do to unwind and help with mental health. Such as resources for therapy, workouts that best help with mental health, and a network of people who use the website to talk to each other. I also want my page to be better aligned and have closer look to my wireframe.
